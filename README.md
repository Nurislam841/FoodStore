# 🍔 FoodStore — Microservices Food Ordering System  
**(Advanced Programming Course Project)**

## 📌 About the Project

**FoodStore** is a university **Advanced Programming course project** that demonstrates a microservices-based food ordering system built with **Go (Golang)**.

The project focuses on practical backend engineering topics such as:
- Microservices architecture  
- API Gateway pattern  
- Inter-service communication with **gRPC**  
- Layered architecture and clean code practices  
- Basic testing and modular design  

The system consists of multiple independent services and a simple frontend client.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The project is structured as a set of microservices:

- **API Gateway** — entry point for clients, routes requests to backend services  
- **Menu Service** — manages food items and menu  
- **Order Service** — handles orders and order processing logic  
- **User Service** — manages users  
- **Payment Service** — handles payment logic  
- **Frontend** — simple client interface  

Each service follows a layered structure:
- `handler` — HTTP/gRPC handlers  
- `service` — business logic  
- `dao` / `repository` — data access layer  
- `model` — domain models  

Services communicate with each other using **gRPC**.

- **Architecture:** Microservices, Layered Architecture  
- **Communication:** gRPC  
- **API:** REST (via API Gateway)  
- **Tools:** Git, Go Modules  
- **Testing:** Go testing (basic unit tests)

## 📂 Project Structure (Simplified)

- FoodStore/
- APIGATEWAY/
- Menu_service/
- Order_service/
- User_service/
- Payment_service/
- Frontend/
- README.md

## 📦 Service Structure

Each service contains:

- handler/
- service/
- dao/
- model/
- main.go

---

## 🚀 How to Run (Example)
⚠️ Note: Each service should be run separately.

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Nurislam841/FoodStore.git
cd FoodStore
Run a service (example: Menu Service):
cd Menu_service
go run main.go
Run API Gateway:
cd APIGATEWAY
go run main.go
Start other services in the same way and use the system via the API Gateway or frontend.
